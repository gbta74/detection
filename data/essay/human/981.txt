New England Bound book by Wendy Warren reviews the period between the 16 th and 19 th centuries, the age of disproportionate slavery on the American continent and European colonization. This book centers around the sixty-year time frame between Desire’s journey and The Selling of Joseph’s distribution, showing how bondage worked in a juvenile pilgrim society and what it looked like, all in all, toward the start of the English frontier venture in North America. In clarifying how subjugation functioned as of now, New England Bound likewise underlines that it worked as of now. Subjugation was in England’s American provinces, even the New England states, from the earliest starting point. While such affluent New Englanders were all the more straightforwardly put resources into the Atlantic slave economy than were their kindred homesteaders of lesser means, subjugation was an always present reality in any event, for a significant number of the settlement’s normal specialists, mariners, and farmwives.
