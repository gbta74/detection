The majority of the article is dedicated to Logos, however, presenting logical arguments and examples. The author stipulates that Propaganda in itself is neither good nor bad, as it can promote different ideals (Cross). She offers examples of real-life rhetoric to demonstrate and allow the audience to perceive how they are being manipulated by various fallacies and demagoguery.
Perhaps the most fascinating part of the article was that, despite the subject being propaganda, it also attempts to sway the reader subtly, by implementing an association fallacy. The majority of examples (excluding one with a quote from Lenin) were right-wing talking points: “The American Way,” “Constitutional rights,” “American Birthright,” “Now I’m a businessman like yourselves,” “‘Community’ and ‘Communism’ look an awful lot alike!” and others (Cross). When examples of negativity can be largely attributed only to one side, the folly occurs as follows: Subject A is generally considered negative. Group B is presented to implement subject A regularly. Group B is, therefore, painted in a negative light. While all of the examples offered were, indeed, propaganda, the lack of representation for the opposing side utilizing the same techniques makes this a politically charged article, and, ironically, a tool for propaganda.
