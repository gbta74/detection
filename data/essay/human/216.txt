As a matter of fact, one of the most comprehensive definitions of marketing was given by the American Marketing Association (AMA). According to it, marketing is “the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large” (AMA, n.d., para. 2). Although all components of the marketing form consumers’ demands, they are also affected by their free choice.
In addition, customers’ free choice affects the delivery of valuable goods as well. In a highly competitive environment, people do not want to wait for a long time or face inappropriate service related to product delivery. That is why companies not only try to optimize their supply chains but to ensure that customers may rely on them in the future if they require support using a purchased product.
