As mentioned above, some huge organizations manage to become extremely popular in some cities, and people become to identify them as a major part of the culture of these areas. For example, the department store company Century 21 is considered an iconic shop in New York and a must-see for tourists (Lisicky). Before COVID-19 made the retailer declare itself bankrupt, which became devastating news for the citizens, it was common for many guests of New York to prefer visiting this department store before seeing other places. As noticed by Lisicky, this shop was “regarded as “New York’s Best Kept Secret” and “has served as a beacon of New York’s style and resilience.” The location of its main store was across the World Trade Center, and after the shop managed to survive the terrorist attacks, it began to attract even more customers and tourists and even became the symbol of New York.
