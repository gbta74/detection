Black women worldwide have problems with access to high-level health care, which impairs their health during pregnancy and childbirth and poses risks to the child’s health. Children are the future of modern society, and every woman deserves quality care to ensure her well-being and that of her child. Systematic adjustments, starting with health care, aimed at improving the well-being of black women and improving the accessibility of quality health care will improve maternal health and women’s possibilities in this matter.

The authors draw attention to the tendency of feminization and racialization in the prevalence of homelessness. They conducted interviews with homeless mothers to investigate the causes of homelessness, factors of gender and race, and their correlation. Bullock et al. (2020) focused on particular sides – economic problems, housing issues, and weak welfare programs. They identified many causes of homelessness among mothers connected with intersectionality. The authors’ central argument claims that there is a need for holistic approaches to address the concerns of inequality and vulnerabilities. Their results show that not only significant problems such as job loss but also difficulties in dealing with more minor issues such as fines have a significant impact on well-being.
The source under consideration is of interest for studying the theme of Black Maternal Health. It provides an overview of the pathway and problems that worsen the situation of black mothers. Homelessness is a critical issue that affects health, and often this problem exists in conjunction with others, like access to medicine or nutritional matters. The difficulties identified prove the need for systemic changes to improve maternal health. The authors also put forward proposals for potential solutions, such as investing in programs for housing affordability, providing legal aid, and strengthening social support policies.
The source has strengths and weaknesses that influence the assessment of its value. The article does not have significant gaps, and its strength in the method used as it helps to understand the experience of the considered population better. Moreover, the advantage is addressing intersectionality, including factors of race and gender. However, the article has limitations and leaves open questions about the influence of other factors, such as relationship with a partner or sexual orientation. Researchers also recognize the homogeneity of their sample, as all women spoke English and were single. Although they had the experience of homelessness, they had at least someplace to live.

The authors provide examples and proof that during the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to barriers established by it, racism continues to have a substantial impact on the health of black mothers. Destine et al. (2020) argue that the pandemic exacerbated existing health problems for black mothers and further complicated the situation for queer, transgender, and undocumented births. As a result, new risks to the health of the mother and child appeared, and the threat to life increased. The authors provide several recommendations to address some of the most significant issues and improve the situation of black mothers.
The source is of interest to the topic, as it discusses additional factors affecting maternal health, particularly the pandemic influence. Moreover, the proposed policy recommendations are also helpful for considering and creating new proposals. While the data presented are the strength of the source, it has several drawbacks. The authors present a literature review rather than a study, which may cause a risk of bias. Moreover, not all identified issues have appropriate recommendations or solutions. The question remains of protecting births from both COVID and maternal health risks. It is necessary to overestimate the authors’ recommendations considering the restrictions and the pandemic factor to answer it.

The study focuses on the issue of implicit bias, which prevents providing decent care for black women. The authors argue that stereotypes, particularly about health differences, have historical roots but continue to affect health care significantly. The problem is supported by manifestations of racism at other levels. For example, there is still an insufficient number of black physicians in healthcare, which may be due to bias, education unavailability, and other factors (Green et al., 2021). In this regard, the authors of the article offer several recommendations. They aim to transform medical education, particularly the elimination of stereotypes. The proposals also offer increased standardization and accountability of care processes and support for racial diversity among physicians.
The source is of interest for the topic under study, as it carefully examines the causes of the problem from within the medical system. Understanding that racism in the educational system is closely linked to bias in health care is critical and supports the thesis of the need for structural change. The new perspective also expands on possible recommendations to address inadequate care for black maternal health.
This review does not have significant gaps and expands existing research disclosing the theme determined by the authors. The benefits of the source are in view from within healthcare; however, there are limitations as methods to combat implicit bias are still insufficiently effective. Moreover, the authors did not use an intersectional approach but focused precisely on the factor of race. Therefore, in studying the topic, it is essential to consider additional sources and explore influencing factors – the economic situation, relations with a partner, and other aspects.

The source is considering a new factor in the problem of black maternal health – mental health. The author argues that existing narratives common in culture and society impair the health of mothers and their children and should be changed. Narratives support racism and the myth of white supremacy and ignore the strengths and significance of black mothers, which makes the situation worse. Parker (2021) propose recognizing the existence and influence of cultural oppression, combating economic, political, and cultural pressure, and admitting the significance and strengths of black families.
The article complements the study of black maternal health by presenting the view of mental health and related cultural aspects. This perspective expands the intersectional question and considers society and culture as sources of oppression for black women. Moreover, in presenting an Afrocentric view, the source more deeply explores racial awareness and competence issues, which is its strength. While the recommendations given are valuable, they still need verification in practice, which is a limitation of the source.
