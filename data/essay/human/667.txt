Introduction
Culture is, in essence, a collection of common beliefs held by a group of individuals. Certain behaviors are deemed normal and correct by cultural standards, whereas others are deemed weird or incorrect (Tombleson et al. 16). In some traditions, personal relationships and unofficial arrangements are significantly more enforceable than any contractual obligation. Cultural interaction refers to the use of speech and other expressive tools by individuals and societies to carry out their operations and responsibilities through symbolic resources (Tombleson et al. 21). Regional diversity affects every area of global interaction. Even the medium of communication chosen may have cultural implications (Tombleson et al. 22). For instance, it has been observed that industrialized countries increasingly depend on computer technologies and place a premium on written text over spoken or face-to-face contact.
How Cultural Communications Affect Lockheed Martin’s Managers Globally Culture
In certain countries, conflict is seen positively, while others want to prevent it. Although confrontation is not generally encouraged in the United States, individuals are encouraged to resolve disputes immediately (Wilce et al. 243). In many Eastern countries, it is preferable to resolve disagreements privately. Furthermore, regional diversity would influence how Lockheed administrators approach activities. There are various reasons for this, including disparities in resource distribution, differing perceptions of time, and divergent views on how partnership and task-oriented labor should coexist. For instance, Asian and Hispanic civilizations focus on group processes at the beginning of the project and divert their attention to the ultimate goal as the program unfolds (Wilce et al. 243). In contrast, European-American cultures place a premium on the task at hand and leave connections to evolve naturally.
Decisions are commonly transferred to a junior in the United States. Self-determination is highly prized in several Southern European and Latin American cultures. In group situations, popular sovereignty works best in the United States, as in the case of Lockheed, whereas concurrence is preferred in Japan. Additionally, some cultures prohibit emotional engagement, the reasons for a quarrel, or private information (Ferraro 72). While specific inquiries may seem casual to a person, they may be inappropriate to someone from another culture. Thus, Lockheed managers would acknowledge this before they can gain a firm grasp on the perspectives and objectives of the individuals with whom they deal. Finally, diverse societies have varying perspectives on knowledge acquisition (Ferraro 72). Europeans value information obtained by numbering and quantifying more than data collected through other techniques (Ferraro 73). On the other hand, certain African cultures place a premium on information acquired through symbolism, while certain Asian cultures place a premium on knowledge acquired through transcendence.
Reason and passion both play a part in international commercial transactions. The one that prevails determines individuals’ effectiveness, their propensity for expressing feelings, or people’s emotional neutrality (Wilce et al. 241). Citizens of collectivistic cultures do not communicate their emotions openly but rather keep them strictly regulated and suppressed. In high-affect societies, individuals express their emotions openly by smiling and occasionally crying or yelling (Wilce et al. 241). Additionally, some civilizations regard time as a linear resource that may be saved or squandered. Other cultures perceive time synchronously, as a continuous influx to be perceived today, and as an uncontrollable force (Wilce et al. 243). Thus, the perspective of Lockheed’s directors in worldwide interactions with countries with a culture opposed to that of the USA may influence their economic dealings.
Norms
In the West, eye contact conveys assertiveness but can be interpreted as impolite or demanding in the Middle East and Asia. Additionally, there are gender-specific restrictions regarding facial expression, with many Eastern cultures prohibiting women from maintaining eye contact with men since it indicates power or physical intimacy (Lee et al. 112). Touch is commonly utilized in conversation, especially in business settings, as demonstrated by norms such as shaking hands. However, other civilizations regard physical contact with other individuals as impolite. Asians are more conservative when embracing, with a bow frequently substituting a handshake (Lee et al. 112). Lockheed’s culture is more conservative, such as avoiding pecking on the cheeks, as many regions of Europe do. Therefore, Lockheed’s global dealing in Asia may be affected by such norms as their managers may misinterpret their Asian counterparts.
Regardless of where an individual is in the globe, the general rule here is to offer people more room than they believe they require and only approach if requested. Physical distance is perceived differently by individuals from diverse civilizations. However, it is better to avoid entering anyone’s personal boundaries, around 2 feet (Odine 55). Certain parts of the United States are happy with completely calm appearances, while others take umbrage at the sight of a bare forearm or leg (Odine 55). The prudent course of action is to wear appropriate. Therefore, when moving to countries where the code of dressing disregards loosened attires, Lockheed’s personnel must dress appropriately; otherwise, no business dealing will transcend. Additionally, one can loosen up their attire if it becomes clear that doing so is okay.
Non-verbal Communication
Regional diversity affects every area of global cooperation. Even the medium of communication chosen may have cultural implications. For Lockheed managers to comprehend the cultural differences in nonverbal cues, they must first distinguish between high and low-context societies. Nonverbal interaction is more prevalent in high-context societies than in low-context civilizations (Ferraro 71). They impart meaning through human interactions, power structures, and cultural understanding. Phrases are more significant in low-context civilizations (Ferraro 71). Direct communication is used, relationships are built and terminated rapidly, and bureaucracies are loosened (Ferraro 71). For instance, it has been observed that industrialized countries increasingly depend on computer technologies and place a premium on written correspondence over verbal or face-to-face contact (Ferraro 72). Realizing these body language distinctions between civilizations is critical for individuals aspiring to operate in foreign markets.
Paralanguage is a term that relates to a non-verbal conversation, and it comprises the intonation, volume, rapidity, and inflection of one’s voice, and comprehension or content of the words used is critical. It is critical to be aware of these concerns and recognize that they are imperceptible in messages and emails, which means extreme caution must be exercised in the phrases individuals choose (Yanfang 34). The intensity at which people talk has a culturally specific connotation; for instance, British English speakers employ volume to communicate wrath, but Indian English speakers use volume to command attention. Additionally, there are cross-cultural variances in the usual background level of communication; Asians and Europeans, for example, speak at a lower intensity than North Americans (Yanfang 34). Non-verbal affective utterances, notably those linked with good emotions, differ by culture; instances include shouts and laughter.
People’s body posture regularly conveys details about their social position, religious practices, sentiments of servility, wishes to preserve the communication gaps, and sexual intents, to name a few. When people communicate, they frequently position their bodies toward one another by adopting a particular stance or posture. Postural signals are compelling indicators of an individual’s inner mood and the behavioral standards of others (Ferraro 86). When people engage in a cross-cultural situation, significant disparities in the positions taken and the ideas conveyed can be observed. For instance, in the United States, people stand to demonstrate respect, while in specific Polynesian communities, individuals sit (Ferraro 87). Americans typically lean back in their chairs and place their feet on the desks to indicate a casual, lax approach, yet the Swiss and Germans would consider this position impolite.
Verbal Communication
Intercultural communication is a type of knowledge that encompasses all of the different systems of beliefs recognized by individuals in society and conveyed through speech. Cultural awareness can help bilinguals avoid writing correct but glaringly unsuitable statements. Cultural norms regarding when and how specific speech actions may vary significantly (Ferraro 67). Common expressions such as salutations, leaving, appreciating, and apologizing do not reflect similar standards across civilizations, resulting in ambiguities and bewilderment (Ferraro 68). The way a culture uses language is inextricably linked to the ideals it espouses and how it feels social interactions should be.
Speech is highly valued in some societies, such as the USA, and it is critical to be eloquent and well-spoken in individual and communal contexts. Individuals in these cultures frequently employ language as a potent instrument for discovering and expressing truth, extending oneself, and influencing others (Ferraro 68). Silence is frequently interpreted as a sign of apathy, outrage, opposition, and even hatred in such countries. They are perplexed and perplexed by the silence, which is so unlike an expected outcome. Many people are even uncomfortable with quietness and feel obligated to fill it with words to alleviate their discomfort (Ferraro 68). Or, if an inquiry is not promptly addressed, people worry that the presenter will assume they do not understand the solution.
The United States, Western European countries, Italy, and Canada exhibit these sentiments. Quietness can symbolize respect in certain Asian cultures (Ferraro 68). If someone asks a question, it is courteous to display that you have considered the subject before responding. When opposing viewpoints diverge, it is frequently assumed that saying nothing is preferable to insulting the other side, which would result in both parties losing face (Ferraro 68). Occasionally, words fail to express ideas and instead serve as impediments. Silence can communicate the communicators’ true intentions and be understood following predicted speech opportunities or have a more significant meaning than words.
In hierarchical societies, the most prominent or oldest individual frequently has the right to talk. In other societies, people are anticipated to stay silent or communicate only when requested to substantiate the knowledge (Ferraro 69). Silence is used to maintain order and tranquility in attentive cultures. It is considered respectful in collectivistic societies to keep quiet when one’s opinion differs from that of the collective (Ferraro 69). In certain African and Native American cultures, stillness is viewed as a means to appreciate someone’s companionship without feeling compelled to fill every instant with noise.
Alternatively, the stillness could result from the individual trying to communicate in a foreign language and having time to respond. Additionally, the act of writing varies significantly in importance in different cultures. Printed commitments are regarded as more authoritative and enforceable in the United States than oral assent (Ferraro 69). For instance, the phrase, “Did you obtain that text?” is a frequently asked question (Ferraro 69). The link between speaking and writing is critical for strengthening dedication. Other cultures place a higher premium on communicative activities than on written correspondence.
Practices
Slang is characterized as an extremely casual language with more symbolic, whimsical, fragmented, colorful, and transitory terminology than a linguistic system. This statement should not lead people to believe that slang is everyday speech (Ferraro 75). Rather than that, slang should be understood as the language of those who identify with a specific set within the more prominent language society. Entrepreneurs have their jargon, which they employ only within their cliques (Ferraro 75). American businesses frequently use idioms such as “dead in the water” (ineffective), “show no mercy” (brutal), “red tape” (complex procedures), and “bottom line” (net profit), among others (Ferraro 75). These types of slang pose two significant difficulties for someone attempting to acquire a second language. Slang expands the range of available expressions in any specific communicative language (Ferraro 75). Additionally, because many slang terms are only used for a few years before vanishing or being adopted into the official form of the language, staying current with contemporary slang patterns is challenging.
Conclusion
Culture is concerned with individuals’ and groups’ beliefs, practices, and behavioral patterns. A society is a collection of lifestyles and cultures, the habits, attitudes, norms, and emblems that they embrace and transmit through conversation and replication down the generations. Cultural communication is a branch of research that examines how individuals from other civilizations interact in similar and unlike ways and how they attempt to engage via their respective societies. Members of different nations perceive events and circumstances differently. They have distinct traditions, perspectives, and behavior concerning one another. When these distinctions collide, complications arise. Internationalization has compelled people from many cultural backgrounds to collaborate. Along with the atmosphere of comprehension and cooperation, many conflicts can be developed during this process. Cultural conflicts emerge due to disparities in individuals’ values and behavioral standards from diverse cultures.
The most critical components of cultural communication in business include initial reactions, initiating and concluding talks, identifying relevant discussion subjects, honoring others throughout dialogues, and learning how to interrupt people without generating misconceptions. Meanwhile, the following distinctions should be noted in international business interactions: eye contact regularity, hand use while speaking, use of first names rather than designations, the physical distance between speakers, persistence, speech velocity, inflection, and use of facial gestures. Cultural communication is key in commerce; however, failing to practice appropriate cultural interaction might result in a person being unwittingly offended. As a result, when a corporation is committed to enhancing intercultural understanding, the ramifications of such an event might vary from a relaxing moment to the success of a wholly commercial enterprise.
