Day after day, hundreds of thousands of people watch dozens of movies, most of which are made in the USA, mainly in Hollywood. The way society uses cinema affects it on a much larger scale than the average person can imagine. From political economyâ€™s viewpoint, it is interesting to observe the influence of a particular film on various socio-economic forces and moods in society.
If one imagines the release of a Hollywood blockbuster with such world-famous actors as Jennifer Lawrence, Jackie Chan, and The Rock, they can safely assume that there will likely be some social changes. Those changes do not have to be immediately evident and transparent. They can grow over time, feeding into new products in the media space. Thus, the US has tremendous soft power, being one of the leading media providers (Douglas and Meenakshi 29). This is due to the ability and legislative framework that has helped the country easily popularize, legitimize and internationally disseminate the American culture.
