The purpose of this essay is to critically analyze an article by James Vlahos, “How Scientists are Bringing AI Assistants to Life.” The author claims artificial intelligence assistants are being brought to life by scientists. The author’s targeted audience includes both developers and users of AIs. The author offers advice to users on how to best interact with virtual assistants. In the same fashion, the author highlights how researchers and developers explore new ways to enhance the efficiency and personable interactions of AIs.
The author posts a strong argument to support his claim that scientists breathe life into an object. Developing an intelligence with a personality the same as a human is an astounding achievement. Creating lifelike personas that make one seamlessly communicate with an AI as a human and the advancement of technology from response generation to speech synthesis is evidence enough to support the author’s opinion. The ability to create lifelike personas for AIs highlights just how close to reality the AIs are. Asked whether she is alive, Alexa, an AI assistant, replied, “I’m not really alive, but I can be lively sometimes.” AI’s do not try to outsmart humans when answering questions, despite their personality traits being just imaginary and almost informal.
