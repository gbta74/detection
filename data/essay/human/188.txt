Asia is a landmass described as the worldâ€™s largest and most diverse continent. It is more of a geographic term and carries diversity among the areas and regions it encompasses. Asia is hardly a homogeneous continent because it covers a vast area from the Caspian Sea and the Ural Mountains in Eurasia. Asia is divided into five regions Southwest Asia includes the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Israel, Iran, and Turkey. Central Asia covers Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan. East Asia, South Asia comprises India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Southeast Asia, Burma, Thailand, Indonesia, and Cambodia.
Asia is a constructed idea with many and varied traditions from the large region it covers. It is not an absolute unity with cultures that share things in common. This is evident in the richly diverse languages of Asia. The vast majority speak Altaic consisting of Turkic, Mongolian, and Manchu-Tungus, while other predominant languages are the Chines and the Indo-European family of Indo-Aryan, Slavic, Iranian, and Armenia. In addition, the Afro-Asiatic and Caucasian languages are bound in Western Asia.
In conclusion, Asia is a collection of many geographically connected cultures. These cultures share histories, such as the western civilization and the growth of centralized agriculture like in China. Based on these realities, it is hard to define Asia as a single unit but a group of regions that change depending on how they are analyzed.
