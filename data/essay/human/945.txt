Introduction
A person’s life is a journey along a winding road filled with bright events, difficulties and obstacles, ups and downs. With each day and each new situation, individuals learn about themselves and the world, gaining unique knowledge and experience. Hence, a person develops a life philosophy, which can change over time and accumulate experience. Therefore, life is a journey where every step today affects “tomorrow.” The decisions should be balanced, and steps should be deliberate. One can enjoy the journey only slowly, admiring the beauty and feeling the “taste” of every minute. This perception of life allows one to constantly discover something new, to search and find what is valuable, as well as to discover the beautiful in ordinary, unremarkable things and appreciate moments. Becoming a college student and finding my identity within the main literary elements from the book “The Alchemist” is the key idea that will be examined in this paper.
