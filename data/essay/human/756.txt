The paper is well structured, so a researcher can quickly look over the framework. The authors efficiently provide detailed statistics, so the data analyzed is relatively straightforward and evidenced. Moreover, utilizing the appendices with supplementary data is essential for the research. Having analyzed the statistics, the authors raise the question of whether cash transfers significantly affected females. It is notable to argue that there were no significant reductions in HIV, labor opportunities promotion, or measurable empowerment of women. Moreover, there are still few jobs for women in the formal sector, so females depend on farming and informal activities. The paper argues that safe and well-paid jobs will significantly contribute to women, especially by reducing child marriage, teen pregnancy, psychological distress, and HIV. The paper’s main conclusion discusses the absence of long-term results since only two years have passed since the program stopped. On the contrary, such a period of financial assistance might have been short. So, the paper sets the goals for further research, arguing that the beneficiaries of financial aid were practically in the same position as they had been before the UCT program.
