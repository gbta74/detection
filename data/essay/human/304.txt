My personal hegemonic experiences might include the observations of skyscrapers in the business centers of the cities. Thousands of companies compete with each other for a fair share of the market. As a result, among the ways to show their dominance and leadership is through their headquarters. Skyscrapers are especially preferred by many, and the higher the building, the better. Another example of hegemony can pertain to a modern political situation that involves one country trying to show dominance over others. For example, while reading the news, I found out about the invasion of one country by a neighboring country.
Hence, according to Roseberry and his narration, Gramsci grasped and stressed, more explicitly than his interpreters, the intricate interdependence of force and agreement in contexts of control. In Gramsciâ€™s use, hegemony was a much more material and political notion than it seems to have become. He recognized its instability, imperfection, dynamic aspects, and fluctuation. Hegemony, therefore, refers to strength and leadership, though it remains a complex subject.
