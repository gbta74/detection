The topic of the essay “From Divided to United during American War in Vietnam” is the war in Vietnam and the perception of it by the American people. In the essay, the author argues that Martin Luther King Jr. fought not only for the civil rights of people in the United States but also condemned the violence that this state imposed on other nations. The essay explores the topic in great detail, however, some changes can further improve it.
From a reader’s perspective, some parts of the essay require additional explanation, for example, the phrase “even so, King worried he should say more.” Here, it is unclear what King would want to say to elaborate on his idea that the United States had “dirty hands.” Additionally, it would be better to separate some long paragraphs into smaller ones and divide the ideas presented in them, for example, paragraph three, which has about five hundred words. To conclude, this essay explores the war in Vietnam in great detail and provides sufficient evidence to support the argument, but some changes can be made to the way the information is presented.
