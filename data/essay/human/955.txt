Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes contrast based on their definitions, the causes, and the management of the conditions. Type 1 manifests through the pancreas producing little to no insulin, which is why it is essential to monitor the glucose levels in the blood (DiMeglio et al., 2018). People who are genetically predisposed are the target groups, and the condition can correlate with symptoms such as thirst, weight loss, and feelings of hunger. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not create enough insulin while cells do not have an adequate reaction to the insulin that is being produced (Roden & Shulman, 2019). Research shows that more than 90% of Americans with diabetes are diagnosed with Type 2, while less than 6% have Type 1 (Xu et al., 2018). Thus, lifestyle is the most critical factor in terms of prevention and treatment.

Based on the fact that Type 1 diabetes correlates with low insulin production while the second type is linked to inadequate response to insulin, managing this hormone that has the function of facilitating the glucose to enter the cell is essential. Moreover, since the gene that regulates the production of resistin is overactive in people with obesity, it is evident that a diet that can reduce excess weight while addressing other diabetes-specific concerns can reduce risks.
Multiple diets claim to be effective in terms of managing type 2 diabetes, yet multiple factors have to be considered. For example, the Atkins diet mainly consists of products high in fiber and low in saturated fat. Since the CDC promotes the avoidance of saturated fat and the increase of fiber intake for sugar regulation, the Atkins diet may be suited for people with diabetes ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). On the other hand, a reduction in carbs may lead to poor glycemic control (Joshi et al., 2019). Thus, the diet has both pros and cons depending on circumstances.
Marketing claims regarding supplements, powders, and teas also target demographics looking for ways to reduce weight. For example, researchers refer to the commonly used ephedra supplements as potentially beneficial in short-term weight loss but mention side effects such as heart and nervous system (Miao et al., 2020). Garcinia cambogia has shown to be ineffective in weight loss and correlates with reports of liver damage ( US Department of Health and Human Services , 2022). Multiple teas, supplements, and powders that claim to be helpful for weight loss are unethically marketed since FDA often finds unlisted ingredients such as sibutramine, which increases blood pressure ( Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , 2022). Instead of opting for uncertified supplements, effective diabetes control correlates with a lifestyle change, including frequent exercise and a healthy and balanced diet. These measures are not only effective in terms of weight loss through calorie intake reduction but also beneficial for glucose regulation.
The case study presents three options, Savannah’s recommendation of following the Atkins diet, Alan’s claim that exercise and healthy eating can lead to positive results, and grandfather’s option of natural remedies. As a low-carb diet, Atkins may be effective since obesity treatment often relies on a carb reduction (Westman & Yancy, 2020). However, Alan’s recommendation of approaching the condition with a balanced overview on health based on activity and avoidance of certain foods is easier to follow and, possibly, more sustainable in the long run (Rubin & Herreid, 2003). Implementing natural remedies may be harmful since, as mentioned prior, researchers refer to the low efficacy and side effects. Thus, Morgan should maintain a healthy weight through balanced meals and higher activity levels.
